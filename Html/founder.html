                Sheikh Ibrahim Khalilullahi Soro 2 (Proprietor of Omo Hiya Group of Schools, Imam Omo Hiya Central mosque, Chief Missional JAOZIAN, Islamic preacher).
               Sheikh was born in 1960 to the (late) Sheikh Abubakar bin Mustapha Omo Hiya al-Barnawi and Alhaja Hawwau Soro, both of Soro’s compounds Gambari area, Ilorin East area of Kwara state. His father was a prominent and pious scholar while his mother was a full housewife who dedicated her whole life to the service of her husband.

               Sheikh soro 2 started Quranic school at the age of 4 years under the tutelage of his father. By 1970, he had completed the reading of the Glorious Qur'an and memorization of some portions therein. Sheikh continued his pursuit of knowledge by starting rudiment knowledge in Arabic and Islamic studies under his father till the latter was demised in 1986.
               Thereafter, he continued learning under his elder brother (eldest son of Sheikh Omo Hiya Soro) in person of Sheikh Mu'mun Abubakar Soro, who taught him different disciplines such as Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence), Adab (Arabic Literature), Nahw (Arabic Grammer) Sarf (Morphology), and many ancient books, etc. Ustaz soro 2  also studied under many scholars such as the late Sheikh Farooq Omo Hiya Soro (his elder brother), Sheikh Adebayo, and many more. During his childhood, Sheikh Soro 2 assisted his mother in hawking and other house chores.
               At his youth age, he dedicated his time to the service of his father who had become old by bathing him, always keeping his company, keeping his property and he had never taken a dime from it. Due to his restless service, Allāh blessed and rewarded him right from his tender age. He got married to 2 wives (Alhaja Habibah and Alhaja Fatimah) and was blessed with 10 children as well as grandchildren. May Allah preserve them all.
